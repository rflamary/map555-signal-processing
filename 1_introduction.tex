In this chapter we will introduce signal processing and discuss briefly the
numerous fundamental problems of signal processing. 

\section{Signal processing}
\label{sec:sigpro-intro}


\paragraph{Signal processing is everywhere}
Signal processing is a field that aim at modeling signals and providing automatic
processing of those signals. 
It has been heavily researched for several decades
and signal processing methods are central part of numerous technologies in
telecommunications, multi-media processing, compression and storage. 
In recent
years, tremendous results have been obtained by using modern machine learning
and artificial intelligence techniques.

\paragraph{Objective of this course} The objective of this course is to provide
an introduction to the very large field of signal processing. 
One fascinating
aspect of signal processing is that it is at the crossroad between Physics (to
generate the signals), Electronics (to measure the signals), Mathematics (to
model the signals) and Computer Science (to process the signals). This
multi-disciplinary aspect has made signal processing 

We plan on
introducing in this documents both the mathematical models, the numerical
algorithms used for their processing and several examples of real life
applications. The implementation of the signal processing methods in Python will
also be discussed with example code and existing
toolboxes. Note that most of the methods are introduced very briefly, but we
will always provide detailed references for a more in-depth study.


\paragraph{Content of the document} The course begins with a short introduction
of signal processing containing a few definitions and problems formulations
followed by bibliographical notes. Chapter \ref{chap:fourier-analog} provides 
a presentation of Fourier analysis and analog filtering
with some applicative examples such as modulation and Fourier optics in
astronomy. Chapter \ref{chap:dsp} introduces signal sampling and digital signal filtering that has
become the de-facto standard in practical applications. It also presents the very
important Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm and discuss some examples of
filtering in image processing. Chapter \ref{chap:random} discuss the random/stochastic aspects of signals and their optimal linear
filtering when modeled as as stochastic processes. The
modeling of speech is taken as an example for the study of
auto-regressive models. Chapter \ref{chap:sig_representations} briefly
introduces  several
signal representations commonly used such as the Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT), and wavelet transforms used in
JPEG encoding and image reconstruction. The short time Fourier transform will also be introduced to model
non-stationary signals. Finally some recent approaches based on machine learning
such as dictionary learning and deep learning signal reconstruction will be
presented.
