## Compilation



The course can be compile using the Makefile. It follows 3 steps:
1. Compile  `poly.tex` to PDF with `latexmk`
2. Compile  to HTML with `lwarpmk`
2. Post process  HTML with `post_process.py` (remove ugly titles, add links to biblio).

It compiles on Ubuntu 20.04 (necessary for a recent version of latex package lwarp).
